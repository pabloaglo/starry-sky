## Random starry sky simulator

This Dash app generates a catalogue of 40,000 stars with randomly generated equatorial coordinates and apparent magnitudes. The coordinates follow a uniform distribution and the magnitudes follow the exponential distribution that fits the 40,000 brightest stars (in our sky) from the Hipparcos catalogue.

The app also allows you to visualize the data in a Star chart or a very minimalist Celestial sphere, with a slide of limiting magnitudes so you can get creative and imagine some constellations of your own, and download the catalogue for whatever astronomical intentions you have. My goal is to build a full-scale randomly generated planetarium, mainly to be used in role-playing worldbuilding, so I'll keep working on it in my spare time.

You can `pip install --requirement=requirements.txt`, run the app and it's ready to go!
